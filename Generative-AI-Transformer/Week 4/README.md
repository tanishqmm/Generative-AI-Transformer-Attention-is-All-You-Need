## Week-4 Assignments

In weeks 4, we will try to implement a Transformer capable of generating text in Shakespearean prose. For insight into how transformers give meaning to the symbols we write in prose, this series of videos by 3B1B is great (https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=JuwbKSezBdLh1lWq, https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=6Zb_qi7ptmOrJnft).

## Week-2 Resources

To get comfortable with implementing a transformer, there is template code available in the file another_model.ipynb, as well as good material available online at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transformer-model-from-scratch-using-tensorflow/ (code here is very buggy), https://github.com/utkarshx27/Language-Model-for-Text-Generation-using-Transformers.git (code here is in pytorch), https://www.kaggle.com/code/lonnieqin/shakespeare-play-generation-transformer and more.
