# WiDS-2024

Welcome to Winter in Data Science Program! We are going to delve in the fascinating world of Machine learning and learn how to create a Generative AI model using the ideas first introduced to the world in the famous research paper, 'Attention is all you need'.  
This README will guide you through the resources and materials provided in this repository to ensure a smooth and effective learning experience.  

## Table of Contents

1. [Week-1](/Week-1/)   
    We'll be diving into the fundamentals of Python and essential data science libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.
2. [Week-2](/Week-2/)   
    We'll be diving into the fundamentals of exactly how Neural Networks work and implementing some small scale 
3. [Week-3](/Week-3/)   
    We'll be diving into implementing the algorithms we have learnt using Tensorflow and then go onto making custom layers and doing some standard ML tasks like MNIST, Housing Pricing etc.
4. [Week-4 to 5](/Week-4to5/)   
    We'll be diving into attention mechanisms and implementing them in tensorflow and then finally starting training a Small language model to generate shakesphere like text.
5. [BONUS WEEK](/BONUS/)   
    We'll be trying to convert the current model we have into a token based model.
