## Week-3 Assignments

In week 3, We will dive into how to implement the the basic neural network we have learnt using a library called Tensorflow

## Week-3 Resources

This week, we'll study about tensorflow, this will be a bit intensive so you should take your time with going through the resources, I would recommend asking any doubts you have on the group so it not only helps you but also helps others having similar doubts <br/>

## Problems we will be solving this week<br/>
* MNIST handwritten digit classifier using inbuilt layers in tensorflow
* MNIST handwritten digit classifier using custom layers in tensorflow
* Assignment: Boston Housing Prices

## Basic Tensorflow Usage <br/>
    - Refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0FFjYumCI) to get a basic feel of how to solve MNIST using tensorflow<br/>

## Optional Tasks
People interested in learning how tensorflow/pytorch works internally DM us and we will provide extra material/ assignments for that
